FAQs
============
FAQs exist as quick answers for frequently asked questions. They should be quick and give a solution as fast as possible. Only after they have given a solution should they suggest further resources. These further resources should not come from the FAQ, they should come from other sources.

FAQs are **NOT** meant to document a general feature of RoboteQ products. To Document a general feature of RoboteQ products, use a Tutorial_

Format
=============

Faqs follow a strict format outline for their form:

1. Start by briefly summing up the problem so that the user can identify with the issue they are having and verify that they are in the right place.
2. Follow by providing a list of steps that the customer can take to fix their issue as quick as possible.
3. End with a section for further trouble shooting steps. This can refer to an application note or tutorial, and should include a link to the RoboteQ techsupport mailing list.
